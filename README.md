# .NET Programming Fundamentals

This project contains implementations of the .NET programming fundamentals exercises, including console applications demonstrating basic concepts, data types, control flow, and object-oriented programming.

## Project Structure

- **HelloWorldApp**: A simple console application that asks for your name and displays a greeting.
- **DataTypesDemo**: Demonstrates various data types and operators in C#.
- **ControlFlowDemo**: Shows how to use conditional statements and loops.
- **OOPDemo**: Illustrates object-oriented programming concepts with Person and Car classes.
- **FinalProject**: An integrated application that combines all concepts into a Student Management System.

## Prerequisites

Before running these projects, you need to have the .NET SDK installed. You can download it from [https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download).

## How to Run the Projects

1. Open a command prompt or terminal.
2. Navigate to the project directory you want to run (e.g., `cd HelloWorldApp`).
3. Run the following command:
   ```
   dotnet run
   ```

## Project Descriptions

### HelloWorldApp
A basic console application that asks for your name and displays a personalized greeting with a fun fact.

### DataTypesDemo
Demonstrates various data types (int, double, string, bool) and operators (arithmetic, comparison, logical) in C#.

### ControlFlowDemo
Shows how to use if-else statements, for loops, while loops, and switch statements to control program flow.

### OOPDemo
Illustrates object-oriented programming concepts including classes, objects, properties, constructors, and methods using Person and Car classes.

### FinalProject
An integrated Student Management System that combines:
- User input handling
- Data type manipulations
- Control flow structures (if/else, loops, switch)
- Object-oriented programming with a Student class

## Notes

These projects are designed for learning purposes and demonstrate fundamental .NET programming concepts. Each project builds on the knowledge from previous ones, culminating in the integrated final project.
