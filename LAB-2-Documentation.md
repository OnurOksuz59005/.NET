## Task 1: Using Generic Collection Classes

**Description:**
This task demonstrates the use of `List<string>` and `Dictionary<string, int>` in C# to store, organize, and display data.

**Screenshot:**

**Explanation:**
- The program lists cities and countries using `List<string>`.
- It displays the population of a city using `Dictionary<string, int>`.
- All requirements and modifications were implemented as instructed.

## Task 2: HTTP Protocol and JSON Data Exchange

**Description:**
This task demonstrates how to use `HttpClient` to retrieve JSON data from an API and display it in the console.

**Screenshot:**
![Task 2 Output](<Insert your screenshot here>)

**Explanation:**
- The program retrieves a post from a JSON API and prints its title and ID.
- JSON deserialization is handled with case-insensitive property matching.
- The output confirms successful data retrieval and display.

## Task 3: Asynchronous Programming

**Description:**
This task demonstrates asynchronous programming in C# using `async` and `await`.

**Screenshot:**
![Task 3 Output](<Insert your screenshot here>)

**Explanation:**
- The program downloads data asynchronously and prints the first 100 characters.
- The console output verifies correct asynchronous behavior.

## Task 4: Creating Visual Applications

**Description:**
This task demonstrates building a Windows Forms application with text boxes, a button, and a label.

**Screenshot:**
![Task 4 Output](<Insert your screenshot here>)

**Explanation:**
- The app greets the user by their first name and surname.
- The screenshot shows the UI with the required controls and a sample greeting.

## Task 5: Visual Containers in UI Development

**Description:**
This task demonstrates organizing controls into visual groups using GroupBox in a Windows Forms application.

**Screenshot:**
![Task 5 Output](<Insert your screenshot here>)

**Explanation:**
- The app uses two GroupBoxes: one for user input and one for counting characters.
- The screenshot shows both features working as required.
